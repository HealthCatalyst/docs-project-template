# Atlas

## Your Window Into the EDW
Atlas is a web-based, user-friendly index of metadata stored in the EDW. Information about columns is generally loaded from source-system data dictionaries and enhanced by subject-matter experts. Use Atlas to search, browse, and analyze that data.

## Discover Information within the EDW
A keyword search combs each data mart, table, and column in the metadata repository to show:

* The source and lineage of data
* How often it's updated
* Data examples, samples, and types
* Descriptions of the physical data tables and columns
* Any known data quality issues
* Contact information for data stewards

## Curate the Data
Atlas's wiki-style contribution model encourages users to:

* Add notes about data and data sources
* Review and refine metadata in the EDW
* Create and edit descriptions for objects in the data warehouse
* Make comments
* Create a self-sufficient community

## Track the Most Up-to-Date Data
