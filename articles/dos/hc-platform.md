# Health Catalyst Analytics Platform

The Health Catalyst Analytics Platform is the breakthrough technology at the foundation of Health Catalyst's Late-Binding Data Warehouse.

## Power of the Platform
It isn't a lack of data that makes it challenging for healthcare organizations to uncover opportunities to lower costs and improve care. Just one patient encounter can generate hundreds of rows of data in source systems spanning nearly every area.

Without a way to organize that data into an enterprise data warehouse, volumes of clinical, financial, patient satisfaction, and administrative data sit trapped in silos. Leaders risk making critical business and clinical decisions based on only fragments of the big picture.

## Turning Data Into Outcomes
Powered by a unique, metadata-driven ETL engine, the Health Catalyst Analytics Platform extracts data from a healthcare organization's many source systems and gathers them into Health Catalyst's Late-Binding™ Data Warehouse, where it binds the right data, at the right time, and at the right place.

When surfaced later in interactive visualizations, decision makers can bring that quality, cross-organizational data into focus and deliver specific, actionable interventions in quality, outcomes, patient safety, and waste reduction.
