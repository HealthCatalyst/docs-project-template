{"title": "Metadata-Driven ETL Engine", "text": "uid: etl.md  # Metadata-Driven ETL Engine  ## In Health Catalyst's View, Metadata Is King. Many enterprise data warehousing ETL models contain no metadata, relying mostly on manual processes to bring data into their EDW. Over many years of updates and code changes – without structure and standards in place – maintenance costs become burdensome and reports are bottlenecked by the time-consuming work required to massage data into new formats.  ## Automated, Metadata-driven ETL Rather than a data analyst maintaining hundreds of ETL scripts and performing each extraction, the Health Catalyst Analytics Platform deploys Source Mart Designer to map source system tables and columns to their Source Mart counterparts entirely with metadata.  Mappings are then used to create one or more ETL tasks for each source system table, automating extractions of data from the source systems. Users define how often they want the underlying data to refresh – up to as often as every 10–15 minutes.   Near-Real-Time Data Metadata-driven ETL offers analysts:   The ability to execute potentially hundreds of ETL processes each night  Reports that rebuild each time metadata is updated   Agile, Flexible, and Scalable Initially, the ETL process does little or no transformation of the source data beyond mapping source system data types to destination system data types. That means that rather than developing the entire data model up front before knowing what all the use cases for the data will be, data is bound late in the process – just in time to solve an actual clinical or business problem.  The flexibility of late binding is a benefit James Dixon also promotes in his concept of a data lake architecture, which preserves data in its unstructured form so it can answer new questions that arise down the road.

{"title": "Health Catalyst Analytics Platform", "text": "uid: hc-platform.md  # Health Catalyst Analytics Platform  The Health Catalyst Analytics Platform is the breakthrough technology at the foundation of Health Catalyst's Late-Binding Data Warehouse.  [health catalyst analytics platform](media/Health-Catalyst-Analytics-Platform.jpg)  ## Power of the Platform It isn't a lack of data that makes it challenging for healthcare organizations to uncover opportunities to lower costs and improve care. Just one patient encounter can generate hundreds of rows of data in source systems spanning nearly every area.  Without a way to organize that data into an enterprise data warehouse, volumes of clinical, financial, patient satisfaction, and administrative data sit trapped in silos. Leaders risk making critical business and clinical decisions based on only fragments of the big picture.  ## Turning Data Into Outcomes Powered by a unique, metadata-driven ETL engine, the Health Catalyst Analytics Platform extracts data from a healthcare organization's many source systems and gathers them into Health Catalyst's Late-Binding™ Data Warehouse, where it binds the right data, at the right time, and at the right place.  When surfaced later in interactive visualizations, decision makers can bring that quality, cross-organizational data into focus and deliver specific, actionable interventions in quality, outcomes, patient safety, and waste reduction.  ## Benefits  Insights in Weeks and Months, Not Years  Fastest implementation in the industry  Rapid time to value  Near-real-time data  > Success Story: Read how Crystal Run Healthcare designed, built, and launched their CAP EDW platform in only 54 days.   Cross-Organizational Discovery  Integrate disparate data across the organization into a single source of truth  Link data (like patient information) between silos  Uncover opportunities for actionable interventions  Quickly adapt to changing needs and market conditions   Powerful, Intuitive Software and Tools  Extract, transform, and load data from commonly available source systems from well-known healthcare vendors – including clinical, financial, and ancillary sources  Create, maintain, and customize data marts  Manage ETL processes  Provide self-service tools to the front lines ", "tags": "", "url": "articles/dos/index.html"},

{"title": "Atlas", "text": "uid: atlas.md  # Atlas  ## Your Window Into the EDW Atlas is a web-based, user-friendly index of metadata stored in the EDW. Information about columns is generally loaded from source-system data dictionaries and enhanced by subject-matter experts. Use Atlas to search, browse, and analyze that data.

{"title": "IDEA", "text": "uid: idea.md  # Instant Data Entry Application  ## Deploy a Custom Data-Collection App in a Matter of Minutes Sometimes a source system doesn't include a slice of data you need. Use the Instant Data Entry Application (IDEA) to build and deploy custom web applications to collect it. Data entered flows right into the Late-Binding™ Data Warehouse.  You can create as many applications as you need, manage them in a central place, and set up mappings and lookup lists to scale for enterprise needs.  [idea dashboard](media/IDEA-dash.png)  ## IDEA Applications Can:  Fill gaps in the data-collection process  Serve as a temporary stopgap measure to collect data while a permanent solution is being implemented  Capture custom lists and hierarchies required for reporting  Collect data for research and quality improvement initiatives  ## Benefits  Create and deploy applications in minutes  Initiate research or improvement projects without requesting IT to build a custom application  Don't have to purchase another product  In practice, through the right culture, IDEA has the ability to end department-level, Excel-based data collection.  ## API Connections A JSON REST API provides programmatic access to create, read, and write IDEA applications from any client.  Extend the IDEA API to other tools, including QlikView, BO, Cognos, and more. Users update existing data based on what they see in the presentation layer.
